      "info": "This started as a pure hack to look at CSS animation. If I have the time I need to rewrite all the logic. As it is, I took all the $rootScope mess and moved code to services, which cleaned it up. I still needed cross-controller communication so I have some event broadcasters and listeners. The proper way to do this would be to design, or at least imagine, a database and layout the Services like a REST or DAO layer."
